## Overview

This repository hosts the public-facing [ACQDIV](http://www.acqdiv.uzh.ch/en.html) database. Currently, it includes longitudinal child language acquisition corpora in the ACQDIV database format for:

- Indonesian (Gil & Tadmor, 2007)
- Japanese MiiPro (Miyata & Nisisawa 2009, Nisisawa & Miyata 2009, Miyata & Nisisawa 2010, Nisisawa & Miyata 2010, Miyata 2012)
- Japanese Miyata (Miyata 2004a,b,c, 2012)
- Sesotho (Demuth 1992, 2015)

These corpora are available in various original input formats (e.g. CHAT, CHAT-XML) via the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) component of the TalkBank system and are made openly available under the [Creative Commons license BY-NC-SA 3.0.](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). 

We have converted the original data formats into easily accessible tables and we have enriched the annotation data, in particular at the morpheme level. We also provide a linguistically-informed subset of grammatical classes for cross-linguistic research. For detailed information about the corpora and the data structures that we use, see the [ACQDIV corpus manual](https://github.com/acqdiv/corpus_manual/blob/master/corpus_manual.pdf).

The ground rules for using corpora from [TalkBank](https://talkbank.org/) and [CHILDES](https://childes.talkbank.org/) are stipulated here and the use of individual corpora used in research should be cited accordingly:

The ACQDIV database also contains privately owned longitudinal child language acquisition corpora from languages that were selected from five clusters calculated via maximum diversity sampling (Stoll & Bickel, 2013) to achieve a typologically maximally diverse language sample:

- Chintang (Stoll et al. 2015)
- Cree (Brittain 2015)
- Inuktitut (Allen Unpublished)
- Russian (Stoll & Meyer 2008)
- Turkish (Küntay et al. Unpublished)
- Yucatec (Pfeiler Unpublished)

Access to these corpora is restricted by the project's [Terms of Agreement](http://www.acqdiv.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:c7318751-f531-43a8-9dbd-b48eee950a4c/terms_of_use_for_the_acqdiv_corpus.pdf). Contact Prof. [Sabine Stoll](http://www.psycholinguistics.uzh.ch/en/stoll.html) for more information.

The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Unions Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 615988 (PI Sabine Stoll).
